# Good Practice

#### Whenever you are uncertain about the result of the changes that you are about to make, always make another branch other than your current branch at that instant.
#### This will not only give the confidence to make changes to the project as thought of but will also give the added benefit of taking decision post the result.
##### If the result is not acceptable then the branch can be altogether be discarded without any damage to the master branch.
